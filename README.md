# Manufacturing Defect Dataset
## Overview
The Manufacturing Defect dataset contains information about various defects identified in manufactured products. 
This dataset is useful for analyzing patterns in manufacturing defects, identifying common defect types, and understanding the associated costs and severity levels. 
It is particularly valuable for quality control and process improvement in manufacturing industries.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes records of defects found in different products. 
Each record provides detailed information about the defect, including its type, date, location, severity, inspection method, and repair cost. 
Here is a detailed description of the columns:

1. defect_id: A unique identifier for each defect.
2. product_id: A unique identifier for each product.
3. defect_type: The type of defect (e.g., Structural, Functional, Cosmetic).
4. defect_date: The date when the defect was identified.
5. defect_location: The location of the defect within the product (e.g., Component, Internal).
6. severity: The severity level of the defect (e.g., Minor, Critical).
7. inspection_method: The method used to inspect the defect (e.g., Visual Inspection, Automated Testing, Manual Testing).
8. repair_cost: The cost to repair the defect.

## Learning outcomes
This dataset can support both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks depending on the analysis goals. 
For example, predicting defect severity (supervised) or clustering defects based on characteristics (unsupervised).

## Dataset Source
This dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
